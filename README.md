Vim DE
---

Yeap, I want to create a plugin, to be able to use NeoVim as an IDE.
Two langs will be supported by my, Java and Python, but it welcome for others.

Roadmap:

* Code navigation
 * super, this, self
 * ctags, cscops, global support
* File templates (or use another)
* Code Hierarchy
 * types, methods 
 * goto child-types
 * implement/override super methods
* Code refactoring
 * Rename types, methods, fields, locals
