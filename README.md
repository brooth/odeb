Vim DE

Yeap, I want to create a plugin, to be able to use NeoVim as an IDE.
Two langs will be supported by my, Java and Python, but it will welcome for others.

Roadmap:

1 Code navigation
** super, this, self
** ctags, cscops, global support
2 File templates (or use another)
3 Implement/Override super methods
4 Code refactoring
** Rename types, methods, fields, locals
